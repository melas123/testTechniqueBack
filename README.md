# Json2Csv

This repository is part of : [MyJobGlasses](https://www.myjobglasses.com/) - Technical Test

The goal of this test is to write a small Ruby lib aiming to convert JSON files composed of arrays of objects (all following the same schema) to a CSV file where one line equals one object.

## Test instructions
### Setup

Some sample files are located in `./input_json_files` and  `./output_csv_files`

You can start by writing a `main.rb` (feel free to change this name) that will perform the conversion when running `ruby main.rb`

### Test criteria
- clean
- extensible
- robust (don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...)
- tested

You have no limitation of time, what we expect is to have a discussion about your choices and your code implementation.

To share your code, it's your choice again : send us a zip or a GitHub link !

Good luck !
